# VBA_Challenge
## Overview of Project
This project was intended to assist Steve in finding the total daily volume and total daily return for multiple stocks so that Steve's parents can be informed on which stocks they should invest in. The total daily volume is the total number of shares that are traded throughout the day so that we can measure how quickly a stock is traded. The yearly return is the percentage difference in price from the beginning of the year to the end of the year. We used VBA, a tool within Micrsoft Excel, to write code that will find the total daily volume and total daily return. The second part of this project was to refactor the VBA code that was originally used in the tutorial so that it runs quicker and more efficiently. Though the original code works for a dozen stocks, if Steve would like to use this code in the future for a larger amount of stocks we will need the code to run quicker, take fewer steps and essentially accomplish the task more simply.

## Summary
### Advantages of Refactoring
If used on future projects with larger numbers of stocks it will be able to handle them better
code can be recreated more simply; easier to understand by those viewing it-- this applies to the assignment because it was easier to understand 
use less memory - run time was shorter
learning how the code works - ability to go through line by line and understand how the code works
### Disadvantages of Refactoring
Time it takes to refactor - spent days/ hours on this assignment
might create new errors or issues - debugging over and over. intially my outcomes did not match the original outcomes and i had to keep going back through and modifying
